               <p>Saarathi is a mobile application developed as a social welfare initiative in response to COVID-19 in India. 
                  The app aims to ensure the safety of the Indian population during the COVID-unlock phase by providing navigation solutions.
                  After India's strict lockdown, the app addresses the challenge of navigating safely amidst the current precarious situation by pinpointing COVID-prone areas using six versatile factors. 
                  It utilizes comprehensive algorithms to assess routes and guide users safely to their destinations. The app draws an analogy to Krishna guiding Arjun in the Mahabharata, 
                  ymbolizing its aim to steer people away from dangers posed by COVID. 
                  Saarathi's focus is on aiding individuals in navigating the new normal while staying safe. The app is available for download and aims to support the community in these challenging times.

               <h5><b>ALGORITHMS</b></h5>
               <h6><b>Routing - Waypoint Routing</b></h6>
               <p>The traditional problem with routing is that it is difficult to provide a complete solution because
                  routing engine services only provide the best paths (time-wise) and this makes it miss the route which
                  might have been the safest. Using the Google API, for example, we get only 3 routes maximum. To get
                  all possible routes between the origin and the destination, we use a recursive algorithm - we reroute on
                  waypoints. This means that on a given route, we try to find new directions on every turn. So, when one
                  route would have just had us take a left on a turn, query the routing engine for new directions from
                  that turn's location again and see if it considers going straight and turning right as possibilities too. If
                  yes, we add those to our list of routes. This leads to an exponential rise in the number of routes.

               <h6><b>Population Density Algoritm</b></h6>
               <p>Population Density algorithm uses data from EU's GHSL calculations which estimates population
                  density based on satellite imaging and India's census surveys. This data gives us a high resolution which
                  yields data for tiles as small as 0.07 square kilometers.
                  Along each route, we evaluate every point on the road and assign it a population density danger rating.
                  It is notoriously difficult to understand how danger rises with increase in population density, so we
                  instead started mapping how change of danger increases with increase in population density. A bell
                  curve perfectly describes how danger changes with increase in population density - the increase is not
                  high at start, it keeps increasing till a high point and then, after the population density becomes
                  extremely high, it becomes so saturated that increase in number of people has no effect on danger.
               </p>
               <p style="font-family: eb garamond; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
                  Let danger be represented by 'D' and population density be represented by 'P':
                  \[
                  \frac{dD}{dP} = \frac{K \cdot e^{-((P-b)^2/2a^2)}}{a \cdot \sqrt{2 \pi}}
                  \]
                  where 
                  \(K = 4500000000\),
                  \(a = 18800\),
                  \(b = 30000\)
                  \[
                  \ ⇒ int dD = \int \frac{K \cdot e^{-((P-b)^2/2a^2)}}{a \cdot \sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot dP
                  \]
                  \[
                  ∴ D = 2.25 \cdot \text{erf} \left(\frac{P - 3000}{2000 \cdot \sqrt{2}}\right)
                  \]
                  After normalization to a range from 0 to 1:
                  \[
                  D = \frac{2.25 \cdot \text{erf} \left(\frac{P - 3000}{2000 \cdot \sqrt{2}}\right) + 1.949}{3.1795}, \quad \forall P \in \mathbb{R}
                  \]
                  We input the population density at a point in this formula to get the associated danger with it scaled between 0 and 1. 
                  After obtaining ratings for individual points, we combine the ratings of all points along the route to achieve the final rating.
               </p>
               <br><br>
               <h6><b>Covid Points Algorithm</b></h6>
               <p>
                  This algorithm uses district-wise data for COVID cases made public by the government to keep people
                  away from infested areas. We use a simple equation for calculating the district's threat.
               </p>
               <p style="font-family: eb garamond; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
                  \[
                  \text{District's COVID threat (DCT)} = \frac{\text{total district cases}}{\text{district population}}
                  \]
               </p>
               <p>Each point along the route is assigned a rating depending on the district they are in. But, because of the
                  increasing number of COVID cases, it will become difficult for this algorithm to remain functional on
                  an absolute scale. To make sure it keeps functioning, we normalise the DCT by the highest DCT of
                  any point along the route. This makes Covid Points a comparative algorithm rather than an absolute
                  one.
               </p>
               <p style="font-family: eb garamond; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
                  \[
                  \text{Point's Rating} = \frac{\text{DCT}}{\text{DCT}_{\text{max}}}
                  \]
               </p>
               <p>
                  After obtaining ratings for individual points, we combine the ratings of all points along the route to
                  achieve the final rating. Refer to the section on Rating Combination and Addition for reading more
                  about the process.

               <h6><b>Point Avoid Algorithm</b></h6>
               <p>
                  Thousands of coordinates across India describing the location of hospitals, public transport spots, non-sanitary areas, etc. are taken and the algorithm drives the user away from these hotspots. We assign all hotspots a weightage according to how dangerous they are (the more the danger, the higher the weightage). To evaluate one point along the route, we first sum up the danger effect on that point from every hotspot in the vicinity and then, we fit the answer to a logistic model to scale answers from 0 to 1. Mathematically,
               </p>
               <p style="font-family: eb garamond; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
                  \[
                  \text{DangerEffect}(DE) = \frac{Weightage(W)}{distance\ between\ two\ endpoints\ of\ hotspot(r)^2 \times n}
                  \]
                  \[
                  \text{Danger Effect Sum (DES)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} DE_i
                  \]
                  Finally, 
                  \[
                  \text{Danger Rating} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.02(DES - 150)}}
                  \]
               </p>
               <p>After obtaining ratings for individual points, we combine the ratings of all points along the route to achieve the final rating. Refer to the section on Rating Combination and Addition for reading more about the process.
                  To increase time efficiency of the algorithm, we geohash all locations; this means that we divide India into small area-wise sectors and assign codes to locations based on what sector, sub-sector, sub-sub-sector (and so on) they are in. Only those locations which are in the vicinity of a point are accessed for calculations. Also, to increase iteration speeds through these geohash codes, we arrange them into a dictionary and train the computer to read these hashes like a human would read a dictionary.
